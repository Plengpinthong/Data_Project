1. Power BI Dashboard – Visualized customer demographics, income, spending tracker, and credit card usage history.
2. SQL Queries – Performed basic data analysis to extract key insights.
3. Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering) – Used Scikit-learn’s K-Means algorithm to segment customers and determine the best target group for the campaign.
